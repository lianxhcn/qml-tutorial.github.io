<main><h1>Chapter 2.3 Quantum Read-in and Read-out protocols</h1>
<p>The terms <strong>quantum read-in</strong> and <strong>read-out</strong> refer to the processes of
transferring information between classical systems and quantum systems.
These are fundamental steps in the workflow of quantum machine learning, responsible for loading
data and extracting results.</p>
<p>Quantum read-in and read-out pose significant bottlenecks in leveraging
quantum computing to address classical computational tasks. As
emphasized in [@aaronson2015read], while quantum algorithms can offer
exponential speed-ups in specific problem domains, these advantages can
be negated if the processes of loading classical data into quantum
systems (read-in) or extracting results from quantum systems (read-out)
are inefficient. Specifically, the high-dimensional nature of quantum
states and the constraints on measurement precision often lead to
overheads that scale poorly with problem size. These challenges
underscore the importance of optimizing quantum read-in and read-out
protocols to realize the full potential of quantum computing. Below is a
detailed introduction to quantum read-int and read-out protocols,
including the basic concept and several typical algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-read-in-protocols">Quantum read-in protocols</h3>
<p>Quantum read-in refers to the process of encoding classical information
into quantum systems that can be manipulated by a quantum computer,
which can be regarded as the <strong>classical-to-quantum mapping</strong>. It acts
as a bridge to utilize quantum algorithms to solve classical problems in
quantum computing. Here, we will introduce several typical encoding
methods, including basis encoding, amplitude encoding, angle encoding,
and quantum random access memory.</p>
<h4 id="basis-encoding">Basis encoding</h4>
<p>Basis encoding is a basic method for processing classical data that can
be represented in binary form. Given a classical binary vector
$\bm{x}  \in \{0, 1\}^N$,
this encoding technique maps the vector directly into a quantum
computational basis state as follows:</p>
<p>$$\ket{\psi} = \ket{\bm{x}_1,&hellip;,\bm{x}_N}.$$</p>
<p>In this process,
$N$ qubits are required to represent a binary vector of length $N$. To
prepare the corresponding quantum state $\ket{\psi}$, an $X$ gate is
applied to each qubit where the corresponding bit value is 1. The
overall quantum state preparation can be expressed as:
$$\ket{\psi} = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{N} X^{\bm{x}_i} \ket{0}^{\otimes N},$$
where $\ket{0}^{\otimes N}$ represents an initial state of all qubits
set to $\ket{0}$, and $X^{\bm{x}_i}$ means applying the $X$ gate only
if $\bm{x}_i = 1$.</p>
<p><em>Example of Basis encoding</em>. Consider encoding the integer $6$, which has the
binary representation $\bm{x} = (1, 1, 0)$. The corresponding quantum
state is $\ket{110}$. This state can be implemented by applying $X$
gates to the first and second qubits.</p>
<h4 id="amplitude-encoding">Amplitude encoding</h4>
<p>Amplitude encoding is a technique that maps classical data into the
amplitudes of a quantum state. Given a vector
$\bm{x} \in \mathbb{C}^{2^N}$
containing complex values, we first apply $L_2$ normalization to obtain
a normalized vector $$
\hat{\bm{x}} = \frac{\bm{x}}{|\bm{x}|_2},$$</p>
<p>where $|\bm{x}|_2$
is the Euclidean norm. This ensures that the normalized vector
$\hat{\bm{x}}$ satisfies</p>
<p>$$\sum_{i=0}^{2^N-1} |\hat{\bm{x}}_i|^2 = 1$$.</p>
<p>The corresponding quantum state is then expressed as
$$\ket{\psi} = \sum_{i=0}^{2^N-1} \hat{\bm{x}}_i \ket{i},$$
where $\ket{i}$ representing the $N$-qubit computational basis states.</p>
<p><em>Example of Amplitude encoding</em>. Consider encoding a normalized vector
$\bm{x} = (\bm{x}_0, \bm{x}_1) \in \mathbb{C}^2$ into the quantum state
$\ket{\psi} = \bm{x}_0 \ket{0} + \bm{x}_1 \ket{1}$. This can be achieved
by applying a rotation gate $U=R_Y(\theta)$ to the initial state
$\ket{0}$, where $\theta = 2 \arccos(\bm{x}_0)$.</p>
<p>Amplitude encoding is highly efficient because it allows an
exponentially large vector of length $2^N$ to be represented using only
$N$ qubits. However, preparing this quantum state requires constructing
a unitary transformation $U$ such that
$\ket{\psi} = U \ket{0}^{\otimes N}$. Efficiently finding such
transformations can be challenging and is an active area of research.</p>
<h4 id="angle-encoding">Angle encoding</h4>
<p>Basis encoding and amplitude encoding are fundamental techniques for
mapping classical data to quantum states, but each comes with distinct
resource costs. Basis encoding requires a number of qubits equal to the
dimensionality of the binary representation of classical data and
necessitates minimal gate operations for state preparation. In contrast,
amplitude encoding is highly compact in terms of qubits, using only the
logarithmic of the data dimensionality, but it involves a significant
gate complexity.</p>
<p>To address this limitation, an alternative is <em>angle encoding</em>. The core
idea of angle encoding is to embed classical data into a quantum state
through rotation angles.</p>
<p>Given a real-valued vector
$\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$,
the encoded quantum state can be represented as:</p>
<p>$$\ket{\psi} = \bigotimes_{i=0}^{N-1} R_{\sigma}(\bm{x}_i) \ket{0}^{\otimes N},$$</p>
<p>where $\sigma \in \{X, Y, Z\}$ denotes a Pauli operator. Since Pauli rotation gates are
$2\pi$-periodic, it is essential to scale each element $\bm{x}_i$ into
the range $[0, \pi)$ to ensure that different values are encoded into
distinct quantum states.</p>
<p>A key advantage of angle encoding is its ability to introduce
nonlinearity. By mapping classical data into the parameters of quantum
rotation gates, angle encoding leverages trigonometric functions to
naturally capture non-linear relationships. This property is
particularly important in quantum machine learning, where nonlinearity
is essential for models to learn complex patterns in data, such as
non-linearly separable decision boundaries.</p>
<h4 id="quantum-random-access-memory-qram">Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM)</h4>
<p>Basis encoding, amplitude encoding, and angle encoding are generally
designed to encode a single item of data at one time, which makes it
challenging to process complicated classical datasets. The QRAM
[@giovannetti2008quantum], analogous to classical RAM, aims to
simultaneously store, address, and access multiple quantum states.</p>
<p>QRAM consists of two types of qubits: data qubits for storing classical
data and address qubits for addressing. Given a classical dataset
$\mathcal{D}={\bm{x}^{(j)}}_{j=0}^{M-1}$ with $M$ training examples,
assume we separately encode each data item into a quantum state
$\ket{\bm{x}^{(j)}}_d$ using one of the encoding methods above. The QRAM
can be constructed as follows: (1) Prepare an $N_a$-qubit address
register where $N_a=\lceil \log_2(M) \rceil$; (2) Associate each data
state $\ket{\bm{x}^{(j)}}_d$ with corresponding address state
$\ket{j}_a$. The whole dataset is therefore encoded into a quantum state
of the form</p>
<p>$$\ket{\mathcal{D}}=\sum_{j=0}^{M-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\ket{j}_a\ket{\bm{x}^{(j)}}_d.$$</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The subscript $d$ in $\ket{\bm{x}^{(j)}}_d$ indicates that this quantum
state resides in the data register, differentiating it from address
qubits, which are denoted with the subscript $a$ (e.g., $\ket{j}_a$).
This convention helps to distinguish between the roles of data and
address qubits in QRAM operations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Example of QRAM Encoding</em>. Consider a dataset $\mathcal{D} = {2, 3}$. Using basis
encoding, each sample is first converted into a two-qubit quantum state:
${\ket{10}_d, \ket{11}_d}$. Each data state is then assigned an
address state, $\ket{0}_a$ for the first state $\ket{10}_d$ and
$\ket{1}_a$ for the second state $\ket{11}_d$. The resulting
QRAM-encoded state is:
$$\ket{\mathcal{D}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \ket{0}_a \ket{10}_d + \ket{1}_a \ket{11}_d \right).$$</p>
<p>QRAM allows the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ to be stored in a coherent quantum
superposition, enabling simultaneous access to all data items through
the entanglement of address and data qubits. While QRAM is theoretically
powerful, its practical implementation remains a significant challenge
due to the need for a large number of qubits and quantum operations.</p>
<h3 id="chapter2:Sec-2.3.2-readout">Quantum read-out protocols</h3>
<p>Quantum read-out refers to the process of translating the quantum state
resulting from a quantum computation into classical data, enabling
further processing, interpretation, or optimization in classical
systems. This process can be considered the inverse operation of quantum
read-in, representing a quantum-to-classical mapping.</p>
<p>Based on the completeness of the information obtained during the
read-out process, quantum read-out protocols can be broadly categorized
into two types, i.e., <strong>full information and partial information
read-out protocols</strong>. These protocols enable tailored read-out processes
that match the requirements of different quantum applications, ranging
from tomography to optimization and machine learning tasks.</p>
<h4 id="full-information-read-out-protocol">Full information read-out protocol</h4>
<p>The full information read-out protocol is used to completely reconstruct
the quantum state, which is used to fully understand the quantum
system&rsquo;s behavior. The most general approach to implementing this
protocol is through quantum state tomography (QST).</p>
<p>QST involves performing quantum measurements, gathering measurement
statistics, and using classical post-processing to reconstruct the
quantum state. In what follows, we introduce two reconstruction
techniques broadly used in QST, i.e., linear inversion and maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE).</p>
<p><em>QST with linear inversion.</em> Linear inversion is a straightforward
method to reconstruct the quantum state from measurement data by
directly solving linear systems of equations. Let $\rho$ be the explored
quantum state and ${E_i}$ be a set of measurements. According to the
Born rule, the probability of measurement outcome $i$ is given by
$$P(E_i|\rho) = \text{Tr}(\rho E_i).$$
In practice, $P(E_i|\rho)$ is not
directly accessible but is approximated by the frequency $p_i$ of
measurement outcome $i$ over multiple measurements. By the law of large
numbers, as the number of measurements increases, $p_i$ converges to the
true probability $P(E_i|\rho)$. Collecting measurements across all
bases, we obtain a linear system $$\begin{bmatrix}
\text{Tr}(\rho E_0) \
\text{Tr}(\rho E_1) \
\vdots
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{E}_0^\dagger \cdot \vec{\rho} \
\vec{E}_1^\dagger \cdot \vec{\rho} \
\vdots
\end{bmatrix} = A\vec{\rho} \approx \bm{p} = \begin{bmatrix}
p_0 \
p_1 \
\vdots
\end{bmatrix},$$ where $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{\rho}$ refer to the
vector representations of matrices $E_i$ and $\rho$, respectively. The
vector representation of a matrix is obtained by stacking its columns
into a single-column vector. For example, the vector representation of a
$2\times 2$ identity matrix is $\vec{\mathbb{I}}_2=[1,0,0,1]^T$. The
matrix $A$ is constructed such that each row corresponds to the vector
representation of the measurement operator, i.e.,
$A=[\vec{E}_0^\dagger;\vec{E}_1^\dagger;&hellip;]$. The vector $\bm{p}$
contains the measured frequencies $p_i$.</p>
<p>Assuming the measurements are tomographically complete, i.e., ${E_i}$
forms a basis for the system&rsquo;s Hilbert space, we can reconstruct $\rho$
by solving the following linear systems of equations, i.e.,
$$\vec{\rho} = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T \bm{p}.$$</p>
<p>A common strategy is to use Pauli operators as measurement bases
${E_i}$. The density matrix $\rho$ of an $N$-qubit system can be
expanded in terms of the Pauli basis as:
$$\rho = \frac{1}{2^N} \sum_{i=0}^{4^N - 1} c_i P_i, \quad c_i \in \mathbb{R}, \quad P_i \in {I, X, Y, Z}^{\otimes N},$$
where the coefficients $c_i$ represent projections of $\rho$ onto the
Pauli basis, calculated as: $$c_i = \text{Tr}(\rho P_i).$$ To fully
reconstruct $\rho$, the quantum state must theoretically be measured in
all $4^N - 1$ Pauli bases to estimate each $c_i$.</p>
<p>::: tcolorbox
The Pauli basis consists of four Hermitian matrics $I$, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$
introduced in Figure <a href="#tab:Q-gates">1.1</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;tab:Q-gates&rdquo;}. These operators form a complete basis for the
space of $2\times 2$ complex matrices. For $N$-qubit systems, the tensor
products of these single-qubit operators span the space of
$2^N \times 2^N$ complex matrics. This makes the Pauli basis essential
for representing quantum states, observables, and their transformations.
:::</p>
<p>A key limitation of linear inversion is that it does not guarantee a
valid density matrix, as the estimated quantum state may lack properties
such as positive semi-definiteness, especially with limited measurements.</p>
<p><em>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).</em> To ensure physical constraints on
the quantum state during reconstruction, MLE is introduced. MLE
reconstructs $\rho$ by maximizing the likelihood of observing the
measurement outcomes, subject to the constraints that $\rho$ is
Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and trace one. The likelihood
function is given by $$L(\rho) = \prod_i \text{Tr}(\rho E_i)^{p_i}.$$
Reconstructing $\rho$ then reduces to solving the following optimization
problem
$$\argmax_{\rho&rsquo;} L(\rho&rsquo;), \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \rho&rsquo; \succeq 0, \quad \rho&rsquo; = \rho&rsquo;^\dagger, \quad \text{Tr}(\rho&rsquo;) = 1.$$
Solving this typically requires iterative numerical optimization, which
can be computationally intensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common challenge across all quantum state tomography (QST) methods,
including linear inversion and MLE, is the <em>exponential computational
cost</em> with respect to the number of qubits. Specifically, the number of
parameters to reconstruct grows exponentially with the system size,
making QST methods feasible only for small-qubit systems in practice.
This limitation underscores the need for scalable approaches to quantum
state characterization in larger quantum systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="partial-information-read-out-protocol">Partial information read-out protocol</h4>
<p>The partial information read-out protocol focuses on extracting
specific, task-relevant information from a quantum state without
reconstructing the entire density matrix. This protocol is efficient and
can be applied to comprehend large-qubit systems. According to the type
of collected information, current partial read-out protocols can be
categorized into three classes, i.e., sampling, expectation value
estimation, and shadow tomography.</p>
<p><em>Sampling.</em> Sampling involves repeatedly measuring the quantum state in
the computational basis to estimate the probability distribution over
bit-strings. Given a state $\ket{\psi}$, the probability of observing a
specific computational basis $\ket{i}$ is given by
$$P(i) = \left| \braket{\psi|i}\right|^2.$$
The empirical frequency of
each outcome from repeated measurements provides an estimate of $P(i)$.
Sampling is particularly useful in the following applications</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sampling over complicated distributions.</strong> Quantum states can
represent complex probability distributions that are difficult to
sample classically. Quantum sampling allows efficient exploration of
these distributions for specific applications, such as probabilistic
modeling and Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimization problems.</strong> Sampling can identify high-probability
bitstrings in quantum algorithms, such as the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm [@farhi2014quantum] and Grover search
[@grover1996fast], where these bitstrings often correspond to
optimal or near-optimal solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verification.</strong> Sampling facilitates the comparison of a quantum
circuit&rsquo;s output with theoretical expectations or desired
distributions, helping to verify the quantum systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Expectation value estimation.</em> For a wide class of quantum computation
problems, such as quantum chemistry and quantum many-body physics, the
computation outcome refers to the estimation of the expectation values
of certain observables on the evolved quantum state.</p>
<p>An observable $O\in \mathbb{C}^{2^N \times 2^N}$ mentioned here is a
Hermitian operator that represents a measurable physical quantity. For
an $N$-qubit system, $O$ can be expressed in terms of a Pauli basis
expansion, i.e.,
$$O = \sum_{i=1}^{4^N} \alpha_i P_i, \quad P_i \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes N}, \quad \alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}.$$
where $P_i$ is the tensor product of Pauli operators.</p>
<p>The expectation value of an observale $O$ with respect to an $N$-qubit
state $\rho$ is $$
\braket{O} = \text{Tr}(\rho O).$$</p>
<p>Substituting the Pauli expansion of $O$, the expectation value is
expressed as the weighted sum of the expectation values of each Pauli
basis term due to the linearity of the trace operation, i.e.,
$$\braket{O} = \sum_{i=1}^{4^N} \alpha_i \text{Tr}(\rho P_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{4^N} \alpha_i \braket{P_i}.$$</p>
<p>To estimate the expectation value of each individual Pauli term $P_i$,
the quantum state $\rho$ must be measured in the basis of the
eigenstates of $P_i$. The measurement outcome is then associated with
the corresponding eigenvalue of $P_i$. Fortunately, the eigenstates and
eigenvalues of $P_i$ can be derived from the eigenstates and eigenvalues
of its constituent single-qubit Pauli operators $P_{ij}$. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eigenvalues:</strong> The eigenvalues of $P_i$ are the product of the
eigenvalues of each single-qubit Pauli operator $P_{ij}$. For
example, if the eigenvalues of $P_{ij}$ are $\pm 1$, then the
eigenvalues of $P_i$ are products of these individual eigenvalues
and remain in ${ \pm 1 }$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eigenstates:</strong> The eigenstates of $P_i$ are the tensor products of
the eigenstates of the single-qubit Pauli operators $P_{ij}$. If
$\ket{\lambda_{ijk}}$ is one of the eigenstate of $P_{ij}$, then one
eigenstate of $P_i$ is $\bigotimes_{j=1}^N \ket{\lambda_{ijk}}$.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure allows $P_i$ to be analyzed in terms of its simpler
single-qubit components, significantly simplifying the process of
determining the measurement basis for expectation value estimation. By
repeating the measurements $M$ times and obtaining the corresponding
measurement results ${r_j}_{j=1}^{M}$, the statistical value of
$\braket{P_i}$ can be estimated by</p>
<p>$$\braket{\hat{P}<em>i} = \frac{1}{M} \sum</em>{j=1}^{M} r_j.$$
The expectation
value of the observable $O$ is therefore statistically estimated by
$\braket{\hat{O}}=\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}\alpha_i \braket{\hat{P}_i}$.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key step in the process is to measure the quantum system in the basis
of the eigenstates of $P_i$. If $P_i$ is diagonal in the computational
basis (e.g., a tensor product of Pauli-Z operators), we can directly
measure the state without additional operations. Otherwise (e.g., for
Pauli-X or Pauli-Y operators), we need to apply a unitary transformation
to rotate the quantum state into the desired basis. Specifically, when
measuring in the Pauli-X basis (i.e., $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$), a
Hadamard gate $H$ is applied to the state $\rho$, i.e.,
$$\rho&rsquo; = H \rho H.$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When measuring in the Pauli-Y basis (i.e.,
$\frac{\ket{0} + i\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$ and
$\frac{\ket{0} - i\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$), a phase gate $S = \sqrt{Z}$
followed by a Hadamard gate $H$ is applied, i.e.,
$$\rho&rsquo; = S^\dagger H \rho H S.$$
Measuring the state $\rho&rsquo;$ in the
computational basis is equivalent to measuring the state $\rho$ in the
corresponding Pauli basis.</p>
<p><em>Shadow tomography.</em> Performing full QST requires an exponential number
of copies of the quantum state, making it impractical for systems beyond
a small number of qubits. Instead of reconstructing the complete density
matrix, shadow tomography focuses on efficiently obtaining specific
properties of a quantum state, such as the expectation values of many
observables.</p>
<p><em>Definition.</em> Given an unknown
$D$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$, as well as $M$ observables
$O_1,&hellip;,O_M$, output real numbers $b_1,&hellip;,b_M$ such that
$\left|b_i-\text{Tr}(O_i\rho)\right|\leq\epsilon$ for all $i$, with success
probability at least $1-\delta$. Do this via a measurement of
$\rho^{\otimes k}$, where $k=k(D,M,\epsilon,\delta)$ is as small as
possible.</p>
<p>@aaronson2018shadow proved that the shadow tomography problem can be
solved using a <em>polylogarithmic</em> number of copies of states in terms of
the dimension $D$ and number $M$ of observables. This result
demonstrates that it is possible to estimate the expectation values of
exponentially many observables for a quantum state of exponential
dimension using only a polynomial number of measurements.</p>
<p>The central idea of shadow tomography is to create a compact measurement
classical representation, or &ldquo;shadow,&rdquo; of a quantum state that encodes
sufficient information to estimate many properties of the state.
Building on this concept, @huang2020predicting proposed a more practical
and efficient approach, termed <em>classical shadow</em>, which uses randomized
measurements to construct this classical representation. The classical
shadow approach consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomized measurements:</strong> Perform random unitary transformations
on the quantum state and measure the transformed state in the
computational basis. These random transformations can be drawn from
specific ensembles, such as Clifford gates or local random
rotations, which ensure that the measurement outcomes capture the
essential properties of the quantum state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Classical shadow construction:</strong> Using the measurement results,
construct a classical shadow of the quantum state. This compact
representation encodes the quantum state in a way that allows for
the efficient estimation of properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Property estimation:</strong> Use the classical shadow to compute the
desired properties of the quantum state, such as expectation values
of specific observables, subsystem entropies, or fidelities with
known states.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Shadow tomography requires exponentially fewer measurements compared to
full quantum state tomography, making it a practical solution for
large-scale quantum systems. Moreover, the shadow of a quantum state
serves as a versatile representation, enabling the efficient estimation
of various properties such as expectation values, entanglement measures,
and subsystem correlations.</p>
