## About

This tutorial intends to introduce readers with a background in AI to quantum machine learning (QML) - a rapidly evolving field that seeks to leverage the power of quantum computers to reshape the landscape of machine learning. For self-consistency, this tutorial covers foundational principles, representative QML algorithms, their potential applications, and critical aspects such as trainability, generalization, and computational complexity. In addition, practical code demonstrations are provided in <https: //qml-tutorial.github.io/> to illustrate real-world implementations and facilitate hands-on learning. Together, these elements offer readers a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in QML. By bridging the gap between classical machine learning and quantum computing, this tutorial serves as a valuable resource for those looking to engage with QML and explore the forefront of AI in the quantum era.
