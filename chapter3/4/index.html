<main><h1>Chapter 3.4 Recent Advancements</h1>
<p>The foundational concept of using quantum computers to evaluate kernel
functions, namely the concept of quantum kernels, was first explored by
@schuld2017implementing, who highlighted the fundamental differences
between quantum kernels and quantum support vector machines. Building on
this, @havlivcek2019supervised and @schuld2019quantum established a
connection between quantum kernels and parameterized quantum circuits
(PQCs), demonstrating their practical implementation. These works
emphasized the parallels between quantum feature maps and the classical
kernel trick. Since then, a large number of studies delved into figuring
out the potential of quantum kernels for solving practical real-world
problems.</p>
<p>The recent advancements in quantum kernel machines can be roughly
categorized into three key areas: <em>kernel design</em>, <em>theoretical
findings</em>, and <em>applications</em>. Specifically, the advances in kernel
design focus on addressing challenges such as vanishing similarity and
kernel concentration by exploring innovative frameworks. Theoretical
studies delve into the limitations and capabilities of quantum kernels,
examining factors such as generalization error bounds, noise resilience,
and their capacity to demonstrate quantum advantage. Finally,
applications of quantum kernels showcase their potential across diverse
domains. In the rest of this section, we separately review the existing
developments within each of these three branches.</p>
<h3 id="chapt3:subsec:qk_design">Quantum kernel design</h3>
<p>A crucial research line in this field focuses on constructing <em>trainable
quantum kernels</em> to maximize performance for specific datasets and
problem domains. In particular, traditional quantum kernels, with fixed
data embedding schemes, are limited to specific feature representation
spaces and often fail to capture the complex and diverse patterns
inherent in real-world data. To address this limitation,
@lloyd2020quantum explored the construction of task-specific quantum
feature maps using measurement theory. Building on this idea,
@hubregtsen2022training introduced a method to optimize quantum feature
maps variationally within quantum kernels, linking this approach to the
concept of data re-uploading techniques
[@perez2020data; @schuld2021effect]. Additionally, @vedaie2020quantum
and @lei2024neural proposed leveraging multiple kernel learning and
architecture search to construct quantum kernels, respectively. Last,
@glick2024covariant proposed the covariant quantum kernels for
efficiently solving the problems with group structure.</p>
<p>An orthogonal research direction is addressing the issue of exponential
kernel concentration, also known as vanishing similarity, in quantum
kernels [@thanasilp2022exponential]. Specifically, quantum kernels,
which are defined as the inner product between quantum feature mappings,
often suffer from the phenomenon of vanishing similarity. This issue was
first highlighted by @huang2021power, who found that quantum feature
mappings are typically &ldquo;far&rdquo; from one another in high-dimensional
feature spaces, leading to vanishing similarity and, consequently, poor
generalization performance.</p>
<p>To mitigate this issue, @huang2021power introduced projected quantum
kernels, which store feature vectors in classical memory and evaluate a
Gaussian kernel. This approach replaces the reliance on the inner
product of quantum states, as seen in traditional quantum embedding
kernels. Moreover, @suzuki2022quantum proposed the anti-symmetric
logarithmic derivative quantum Fisher kernel, which avoids the
exponential kernel concentration problem by encoding geometric
information of the input data. Beyond developing new types of quantum
kernels, @shaydulin2022importance and @canatar2022bandwidth explored
strategies to mitigate the exponential concentration issue for quantum
embedding kernels by scaling input data with carefully chosen
hyperparameters. This approach clusters the data-encoded quantum states
closer together in feature space, reducing the risk of vanishing
similarity at the cost of slightly lowering expressivity.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-studies-of-quantum-kernels">Theoretical studies of quantum kernels</h3>
<p>The theoretical studies of quantum kernels aim to rigorously understand
their performance potential and limitations under realistic conditions,
enabling the design of more effective, robust, and generalizable quantum
kernel methods. Prior literature in this context focuses on exploring
two aspects of quantum kernels, namely, expressivity and generalization
ability.</p>
<h4 id="expressivity-of-quantum-kernels">Expressivity of quantum kernels</h4>
<p>The expressivity of quantum kernels refers to their capacity to capture
complex data relationships and represent intricate patterns in the
feature space. A common approach to studying this is through the
analysis of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which provides
insights into the underlying feature representations of quantum kernels.</p>
<p>@schuld2021supervised rigorously analyzed the RKHS of embedding-based
quantum kernels and established the universality approximation theorem,
demonstrating that quantum kernels can approximate a wide class of
functions. Building on this, @jerbi2023quantum extended the analysis by
investigating parameterized quantum embedding kernels, introducing a
data-reuploading structure and proving a corresponding universality
approximation theorem. These results underscore the expressive power of
quantum kernels in representing complex data structures.</p>
<p>Despite these advances, the studies on expressive power and universality
approximation often overlook the efficiency of constructing quantum
kernels. Specifically, if the computational cost of constructing a
universal quantum kernel is comparable to that of classical methods, the
practical advantages of quantum kernels become questionable.</p>
<p>To narrow this gap, @gil2024expressivity examined the expressive power
of efficient quantum kernels that can be implemented on quantum
computers within polynomial time. Their work provides a detailed
analysis of the types of kernels that are achievable with a polynomial
number of qubits and within polynomial time, offering insights into the
feasibility and practical utility of quantum kernels in real-world
scenarios.</p>
<p>However, alongside the exploration of expressive power, a significant
challenge-known as exponential kernel concentration-has been identified.
@thanasilp2022exponential identified four key factors contributing to
this issue: high expressivity of data embeddings, global measurements,
entanglement, and noise. To address this limitation, substantial
research has focused on designing advanced quantum kernels to mitigate
exponential kernel concentration, as discussed in
Chapter <a href="#chapt3:subsec:qk_design">1.5.1</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;chapt3:subsec:qk_design&rdquo;}.</p>
<h4 id="generalization-of-quantum-kernels">Generalization of quantum kernels</h4>
<p>The generalization ability of a learning model&mdash;its capacity to perform
well on unseen data&mdash;is a critical factor in evaluating its
effectiveness. In this context, a considerable body of research has
investigated the generalization ability of quantum kernels.
@huang2021power established a data-dependent generalization error bound
for quantum kernels and demonstrated that, for certain types of data
(such as those generated by quantum circuits), quantum kernels can
achieve a generalization advantage over classical learning models.</p>
<p>In addition, @wang2021towards explored the generalization performance of
quantum kernels in the noisy scenario, where practical limitations such
as finite measurements and quantum noise are taken into account. Their
work rigorously showed that the generalization performance of quantum
kernels could be significantly degraded in scenarios involving large
training datasets, limited measurement repetitions, or high levels of
system noise. To address these challenges, they proposed an effective
method based on indefinite kernel learning to help preserve
generalization performance under such constraints.</p>
<p>Beyond quantum data, @liu2021rigorous examined the generalization error
of quantum kernels using artificial classical datasets, such as those
based on the discrete logarithm problem. Their results demonstrated that
quantum kernels could achieve accurate predictions in polynomial time
for such problems, whereas classical learning models require exponential
time, highlighting the potential computational advantages of quantum
kernels.</p>
<p>Despite these promising results, @kubler2021inductive studied the
generalization ability of quantum kernels from the perspective of
inductive bias. They argued that quantum kernels, lacking inductive
bias, often fail to outperform classical models in practical scenarios.
This underscores the importance of carefully designing embeddings and
aligning kernels to achieve meaningful and practical quantum advantages.</p>
<h4 id="provable-advantages-of-quantum-kernels">Provable advantages of quantum kernels</h4>
<p>The potential for quantum kernels to demonstrate quantum advantage has
been a central focus of research. For instance, @huang2021power provided
evidence of generalization advantages for quantum kernels on quantum
data. Similarly, @liu2021rigorous presented a rigorous framework showing
that quantum kernels can efficiently solve problems like the discrete
logarithm problem, which is believed to be intractable for classical
computers under standard cryptographic assumptions. Moreover,
@sweke2021quantum demonstrated quantum advantage in distribution
learning tasks, offering some of the earliest theoretical evidence of
quantum advantage in machine learning.</p>
<p>However, many of these tasks are artificial, designed specifically to
showcase quantum advantages. This raises the question of how these
theoretical benefits can be translated to real-world applications. In
this regard, the next significant challenge is to demonstrate that
quantum models can consistently outperform classical models in solving
practical, real-world problems.</p>
<h3 id="applications-of-quantum-kernels">Applications of quantum kernels</h3>
<p>Motivated by the potential of quantum kernels to recognize complex data
patterns, numerous studies have explored their practical applications
across diverse fields, including classification, drug discovery, anomaly
detection, and financial modeling.</p>
<p>For instance, @beaulieu2022quantum investigate the use of quantum
kernels for image classification, specifically in identifying real-world
manufacturing defects. Similarly, @rodriguez2024satellite apply quantum
kernels to satellite image classification, a task of particular
importance in the earth observation industry. In the field of quantum
physics, @sancho2022quantum and @wu2023quantum leverage quantum kernels
to recognize phases of quantum matter, where quantum kernels outperform
classical learning models in solving certain problems. In drug
discovery, @batra2021quantum explore the potential of quantum kernels to
accelerate and improve the identification of promising compounds.</p>
<p>Quantum kernels have also been explored in anomaly detection.
@liu2018quantum demonstrate their superior performance over classical
methods in detecting anomalies within quantum data. Furthermore,
@grossi2022mixed employ quantum kernel methods for fraud classification
tasks, showing improvements when benchmarked against classical methods.
@miyabe2023quantum expand their application to the financial domain by
proposing a quantum multiple-kernel learning methodology. This approach
broadens the scope of quantum kernels to include credit scoring and
directional forecasting of asset price movements, highlighting their
potential utility in financial services.</p>
<p>Despite the promise shown in these applications, the realization of
quantum advantage in practical tasks remains an ongoing area of
research, with current efforts directed toward identifying real-world
problems where quantum kernels outperform classical alternatives.</p>
